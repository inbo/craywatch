[Petridish](https://github.com/peterdesmet/petridish) is a Jekyll theme for research project websites. Or your personal blog or lab website. 👩‍🔬 It's mobile-friendly (thanks to [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/)), free, easy to customize, and designed to work well with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

## Some Markdown instructions

This is how to link to other pages:

- [About](/about/)
- [Species](/species/)
- [Faxonius limosus](/species/faxonius-limosus/)

I am `code`, while I am **bold**. I am *italic*. I am _italic_ too.

An empty line to create a paragraph.
Starting a new line in Markdown is good for readability of the `.md` file, but it doesn't affect the rendered text of the website.
In this way you can avoid too long lines.
So, let's make short lines 😄
